# Equipped Landing Page - Lead Generation & Conversion Flow

## Flow Overview

**Name:** Equipped Public Landing Page to Onboarding
**Purpose:** Convert cold traffic into qualified leads and free-tier users through a clear value proposition, social proof, and multiple conversion pathways tailored to different user roles.

The landing page operates as a multi-path funnel:
- **Self-serve path:** Direct sign-up for free tier (end-users, small teams)
- **Enterprise path:** "I'm a Consultant" route (resellers, managed service providers, enterprises)
- **Education path:** Blog content linking to use cases (Mac leasing benefits, asset management)
